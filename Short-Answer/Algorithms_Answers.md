#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
###### o(1)- (answer)
###### while loop with one comparison
###### doesnt matter what n is, it will be the same process
###### one function run on A
###### operations is in direct relation to the size of n
######

b)
###### O(n^2) - (answer)
###### main loop is O(n) 1:1 ratio of operations to size of n
###### inner loop , iterating each N and then doing 2 operations on each
###### Each loop is O(n) since one is inside the other, its going to be n to the power of n operations

c)
###### O(n)
###### recursive code
###### one input as bunnies gets bigger, as bunnies grows by one it will recurse one time for each
###### will grow in direct relation to N but not exponentially it just runs again until bases case is hit
